Bootstrap configuration
----------------------------------

The bootstrap script can optionally take the -c option with an argument
that is the full path to a configuration file. The value is a text file
that contains key = value pairs describing how to setup configuration
needed for CLIP to build successfully. The supported configuration
values are as follows:

	- distro: Describes whether CLIP is building on a centos or redhat machine.
	Valid values are c for CentOS and r for redhat.
	- repo_name: Name of a yum repo that clip will use for packages when building
	Note: All repo names must be associated with a path. Names will be matched to
	paths in the order they are read from the config file.
	- repo_path: Absolute path of the directory containing the packages for the
	yum repo. Note: All repos must be associated with a name. Paths will be matched
	to names in the order they are found in the config file.
